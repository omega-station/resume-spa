# resume-spa

This is the front-end of Paul Kevin Koehler's resume website.

This website was scratch-built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) (leveraging [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)) using CSS in JS via [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/), Test Driven Development via [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) &amp; [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro), and even a little [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). It consumes content provided by a [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) backend, using mostly [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/), and leverages [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)/[Apollo](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client). It also uses [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/react-fontawesome) icons here and there.

No tables were used in the production of this website, nor were any animals harmed. That monkey did get on my nerves, thoughâ€¦
