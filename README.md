# resume-spa

This is the front-end of Paul Kevin Koehler's resume website.

This website is built with <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">React</a> (leveraging <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TypeScript</a>) using CSS in JS via <a href="https://emotion.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emotion</a>, Test Driven Development via <a href="https://jestjs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jest</a> &amp; <a href="https://airbnb.io/enzyme/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enzyme</a>, and even a little <a href="https://storybook.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Storybook</a>. It consumes content provided by a <a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress</a> backend (using mostly <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ACFs</a>) and a <a href="https://graphql.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GraphQL</a> API.

No animals were harmed in the making of this website. Seriously, that monkey was lying through his banana-caked teeth!
