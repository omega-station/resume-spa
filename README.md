# resume-spa

This is the front-end of Paul Kevin Koehler's resume website.

This website is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) (leveraging [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)) using CSS in JS via [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/), Test Driven Development via [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) &amp; [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/), and even a little [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). It consumes content provided by a [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) backend (using mostly [ACFs](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/)) and a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) API.

No animals were harmed in the making of this website. Seriously, that monkey was lying through his banana-caked teeth!
